Your goal is to generate a sequence of actions that are stored in a variable named `gen_plan`

The checker may fail, in which case it will return feedback about what constraints caused the failure.
In the event of a failure, propose a modified plan that avoids all potential reasons for failure.

DO NOT use placeholders, equations, mathematical operations. 
Always give a ground plan that could be directly executed in the environment.

You must always return a block of python code that assigns a list of actions to a variable named EXACTLY `gen_plan`
